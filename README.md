# 3dprinted_turntable

Code for wifi 3d printed turntable,

Remixed from awesome design of thingiverse user @Bribro12
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3958326

Adapted for esp8266/esp32, control by web server,
and in the future the intention of sending bluetooth
commands for activating a camera, for photogrammetry use.

Works only with accelerated move, not constant speed.
